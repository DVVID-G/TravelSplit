## 🟡 Medium Priority Issues

### 1. Accessibility: Missing Aria Label for Checkbox in BeneficiariesSelector

> 🟡 **Medium Issue:** Checkboxes lack descriptive aria-label, relying only on visual label association
> 
> **Location:** `Frontend/src/components/molecules/BeneficiariesSelector.tsx` around line 91
> 
> **Description:** 
> The checkbox input elements use visual label association via wrapping `<label>` elements, but lack explicit `aria-label` attributes. While the current implementation is functional, adding explicit aria-label improves accessibility for screen readers, especially in complex forms where context might be ambiguous.
> 
> **Impact:**
> Screen reader users may experience reduced context when navigating through beneficiary checkboxes. While the current implementation works, explicit labels provide clearer context and better accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA).
> 
> **Fix Prompt:**
> In `Frontend/src/components/molecules/BeneficiariesSelector.tsx` around line 91, add an explicit `aria-label` attribute to the checkbox input element. Change the input to include: `aria-label={\`Seleccionar a ${participant.user?.nombre || \`Usuario ${participant.user_id.slice(0, 8)}\`} como beneficiario\`}`. This provides screen readers with explicit context about what the checkbox represents.

### 2. Form Validation: Generic Zod Error Messages

> 🟡 **Medium Issue:** Zod schema uses generic "message" parameter instead of specific error type messages
> 
> **Location:** `Frontend/src/schemas/expense.schema.ts` around lines 10-15
> 
> **Description:** 
> The `createExpenseSchema` uses generic `message` parameter for number validation instead of using more specific error messages like `invalid_type_error` for type mismatches. While the current implementation works after the TypeScript fix, Zod provides more granular error message controls (`invalid_type_error`, `required_error`) that should be used appropriately.
> 
> **Impact:**
> Users receive the same generic error message regardless of whether they entered invalid data (e.g., text instead of number) or left the field empty. More specific error messages would improve user experience by being more actionable.
> 
> **Fix Prompt:**
> In `Frontend/src/schemas/expense.schema.ts` around lines 10-15, replace the generic `message` parameter with more specific error types. For the `amount` field, use: `z.coerce.number({ invalid_type_error: 'El monto debe ser un número válido' }).positive('El monto debe ser positivo').int('El monto no debe tener decimales')`. For `category_id`, use: `z.coerce.number({ invalid_type_error: 'Debe seleccionar una categoría válida' })`. The `z.coerce` helper will automatically convert string inputs to numbers, providing better form handling.

## 🟢 Low Priority Issues

### 1. Focus State Consistency: Toast Close Button

> 🟢 **Low Issue:** Toast close button uses custom focus-visible styles that differ slightly from other components
> 
> **Location:** `Frontend/src/components/atoms/Toast.tsx` around line 40
> 
> **Description:** 
> The Toast close button implements `focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-current focus-visible:ring-offset-2` with `ring-current` (inheriting text color), while most other components use `focus-visible:ring-violet-600`. This creates a minor visual inconsistency in focus states across the application.
> 
> **Impact:**
> Very minor: Creates slight visual inconsistency in keyboard navigation focus indicators. The current implementation is functional and accessible, but standardizing focus rings improves design system consistency.
> 
> **Fix Prompt:**
> In `Frontend/src/components/atoms/Toast.tsx` around line 40, consider standardizing the focus ring color to match other components. Replace `focus-visible:ring-current` with `focus-visible:ring-slate-600` (for neutral toasts) or create variant-specific focus colors: `focus-visible:ring-emerald-600` for success, `focus-visible:ring-red-600` for error, and `focus-visible:ring-slate-600` for info. This maintains visual consistency with the rest of the application's focus states.

### 2. UX Writing: Beneficiaries Empty State Message

> 🟢 **Low Issue:** Empty state message could be more actionable and less technical
> 
> **Location:** `Frontend/src/components/molecules/BeneficiariesSelector.tsx` around line 78
> 
> **Description:** 
> The empty state message "No hay otros participantes disponibles. El pagador no puede ser beneficiario." is clear but slightly technical. The second sentence could be reframed more positively to explain what the user should do rather than what they can't do.
> 
> **Impact:**
> Minor: The current message is functional and clear. A more user-friendly message would provide slightly better UX by being more action-oriented and less restrictive in tone.
> 
> **Fix Prompt:**
> In `Frontend/src/components/molecules/BeneficiariesSelector.tsx` around line 78, consider reframing the empty state message to be more action-oriented. Replace with: `"No hay otros participantes para dividir el gasto. Agrega más personas al viaje para incluir beneficiarios."` This maintains clarity while being more constructive and guiding the user toward a solution.

### 3. Code Documentation: Missing JSDoc for Handler Functions

> 🟢 **Low Issue:** Complex handler functions in ExpenseForm lack JSDoc comments explaining their purpose
> 
> **Location:** `Frontend/src/components/molecules/ExpenseForm.tsx` around lines 88-133
> 
> **Description:** 
> Handler functions like `handlePayerSelect`, `handleBeneficiaryToggle`, `handleSelectAll`, etc. perform important business logic (e.g., removing payer from beneficiaries) but lack JSDoc comments. While the code is readable, documentation would improve maintainability and help future developers understand the business rules.
> 
> **Impact:**
> Very minor: Affects code maintainability but not functionality. The current implementation is clear enough to understand, but documentation would speed up onboarding and reduce cognitive load for code reviews.
> 
> **Fix Prompt:**
> In `Frontend/src/components/molecules/ExpenseForm.tsx` around lines 88-133, add JSDoc comments to all handler functions. For example:
> ```typescript
> /**
>  * Handles payer selection and automatically removes the payer from beneficiaries list
>  * Business rule: The payer cannot be a beneficiary of their own expense
>  * @param payerId - UUID of the selected payer
>  */
> const handlePayerSelect = (payerId: string) => { ... }
> 
> /**
>  * Selects all available participants as beneficiaries, excluding the current payer
>  * Respects the business rule that payer cannot be a beneficiary
>  */
> const handleSelectAll = () => { ... }
> ```

## ✅ Positive Observations

### Design System Compliance
- ✅ **Perfect Tailwind Token Usage:** All components use standard Tailwind classes (`rounded-xl`, `p-3`, `gap-3`, etc.) with zero magic numbers
- ✅ **Color Tokens:** Proper use of semantic colors from tailwind.config.ts (`violet-600`, `emerald-500`, `red-500`, `slate-50`)
- ✅ **Typography:** Consistent font usage with `font-heading` for labels and proper text sizing

### Accessibility
- ✅ **Focus States:** All interactive elements (buttons, inputs, checkboxes) have proper `focus-visible` states with visible rings
- ✅ **Keyboard Navigation:** All components are keyboard-navigable with proper tabindex behavior
- ✅ **ARIA Attributes:** Toast component uses `role="alert"` and `aria-live="polite"` correctly
- ✅ **Semantic HTML:** Proper use of `<label>`, `<button type="button">`, `<select>` elements

### User Experience
- ✅ **Business Logic Validation:** BeneficiariesSelector correctly filters out payer from beneficiaries list (line 33-35)
- ✅ **Default States:** ExpenseForm sets sensible defaults (current user as payer, all participants as beneficiaries)
- ✅ **Error Handling:** All form fields display validation errors with clear red styling and messages
- ✅ **Loading States:** Button shows "Guardando..." state during submission with proper disabled state
- ✅ **Interactive Feedback:** Hover states (`hover:bg-slate-50`) and transitions (`transition-colors`) provide visual feedback

### Code Quality
- ✅ **TypeScript Errors Resolved:** All compilation errors fixed, build passes successfully
- ✅ **Clean Code:** No unused imports, no unused variables, proper type safety throughout
- ✅ **Consistent Patterns:** All selectors follow similar structure and styling patterns
- ✅ **Form Validation:** Proper react-hook-form + Zod integration with validation on blur and submit

## Recommendations for Future Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Error Messages (Low Priority)
Consider implementing more user-friendly error messages that explain what went wrong and how to fix it:
- Current: "El monto debe ser un número"
- Better: "El monto debe ser un número válido (sin letras ni símbolos)"

### 2. Loading States for Async Operations (Medium Priority)
When implementing the `handleInviteByEmail` function (currently shows alert), ensure proper loading state and error handling:
```typescript
const [isInviting, setIsInviting] = useState(false);
// Show spinner or disabled state while inviting
// Display toast on success/error instead of alert()
```

### 3. Empty State Enhancement (Low Priority)
Consider adding an illustrative icon to the BeneficiariesSelector empty state to make it more visually engaging:
```tsx
<div className="text-center py-8">
  <Users className="w-12 h-12 text-slate-300 mx-auto mb-2" />
  <p className="text-sm text-slate-500">...</p>
</div>
```

## Conclusion

The reviewed components demonstrate **excellent adherence to the Design System Guide** with proper use of Tailwind tokens, semantic colors, and accessibility features. The recent TypeScript error fixes have successfully resolved all compilation blockers without introducing any new UI/UX issues.

**No blocking issues found.** The identified improvements are minor enhancements that would polish the user experience but are not required for production deployment.

**Overall Score:** 9.5/10 (Production Ready)

The 0.5 deduction is solely for the minor improvements identified in accessibility labels and validation message specificity, which represent opportunities for polish rather than actual problems.
